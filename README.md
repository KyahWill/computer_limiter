# Computer Limiter
- Allows the user to create warnings and dialogue boxes that forces them to take a break when using the computer. 

## Note:
You must know how to download Python already. I'll be finding out a way to create an installer for this for future uses.
## Instructions to use:
1. Clone File:
2. If In Linux:
    * run *python (or python3 ) test.py &*
3. If in Windows:
    - press win + r
    - type *shell:startup*
    - put *main.py* in the folder opened
    - changed name to main.pyw
    - restart computer
## Notes:
1. To exit early, press 'E'
2. To test the tkinter module, run it with --test parameter

## Things to do:
1. Create a python "installer" script that allows for re-configuration whenever necessary.
2. Create a "GUI" manager for computer limiter.
3. Add shutdown commands for mac & linux & windows

## Packages Needed:
1. tkinter
2. os
3. datetime
